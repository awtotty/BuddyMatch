# BuddyMatch

## Purpose
This application matches new students with older mentors who are 
current current students. The application serves as one part of
a senior capstone project completed at Windward School in Los 
Angeles, CA.   

## How-to
The algorithm runs with any `.csv` files in which the first row 
contains the headers for the columns. The columns should contain a 
name or an email address for each row as identification. Each 
subsequent column should contain user answers to questions. 

Select the source file for new students and the source file for 
potential buddies. You may specify an export location for the 
results, or the file `buddyResults.txt` will be created in the 
folder containing the new students source. 

### Using Google Forms 
Export the results of a Google Form to Google Sheets, then 
download the Google Sheet as `.csv`. Follow the instructions above 
to run the algorithm.
